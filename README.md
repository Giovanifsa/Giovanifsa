### ðŸ¦† Welcome to my profile!

As you see, I'm not the most active person on Github, as I have a full time job.
This profile is mostly used for things that I do on my free time, like courses, or personal projects.

Feel free to fork, create a issue and criticize my projects. 

If you wish to collaborate, you can create a issue in one of projects telling me so, or you can contact me at the e-mail on my profile.

See ya!
